# NodeJS Programming

Welcome to the **NodeJS Programming** sprint!  
This sprint is designed to give you a strong foundation in Node.js and JavaScript fundamentals. You will explore how JavaScript behaves behind the scenes, and how to write structured, efficient, and modern JS code in a Node environment.

---

## Sprint Goals

By the end of this sprint, you will be able to:

- Work confidently with Node.js and NPM
- Understand how JavaScript runs using the Event Loop
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Use JavaScript features like closures, bindings, and scopes effectively
- Write cleaner code using modern syntax and patterns
- Understand how browser-like behaviors (alert, prompt, etc.) map to server-side JS

---

## Main Topics

###  NodeJS & NPM
- What is Node.js and how it works
- Installing and using packages with NPM
- Creating and running your own Node.js apps

### OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Creating objects and classes
- Using constructors and methods
- Understanding `this` and inheritance in JavaScript

### Event Loop & Event Handlers
- How JavaScript handles tasks asynchronously
- Understanding the call stack, queue, and microtasks
- Writing and using event listeners

### Type Conversions & Comparisons
- Implicit vs. explicit type conversions
- Loose vs. strict comparisons
- `==` vs `===`, and truthy/falsy values

### JavaScript Core Features
- `"use strict"` mode for safer coding
- Conditional branching: `if`, `switch`, `else`
- Interaction methods: `alert`, `prompt`, `confirm`
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)
- Polyfills and transpilers (like Babel) for compatibility

### Recursion & Stack
- Writing recursive functions
- Understanding how stack overflow happens

### Modern Syntax
- Rest parameters (`...args`) and spread syntax (`...arr`)
- Variable scope: `var`, `let`, `const`
- Closures: how inner functions remember their outer variables

---

## Sub-Topics

### IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
- Functions that run as soon as they are defined

### NFE (Named Function Expressions)
- Functions that have internal names for recursion or debugging

### The `"new Function"` Syntax
- Dynamically creating functions using strings

### Scheduling
- `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and managing async tasks

### Decorators & Forwarding
- Enhancing functions or classes by wrapping them

### `call`, `apply`, and `bind`
- Manually setting the value of `this` in a function

---

##  Tools & Setup

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- VS Code or any modern code editor
- NPM (comes with Node.js)
- Optional: Babel for transpiling

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Be able to build basic Node.js apps and scripts
- Understand how JavaScript works at a deeper level
- Use modern syntax and best practices in real-world code
- Gain confidence working with asynchronous code and OOP in JS
