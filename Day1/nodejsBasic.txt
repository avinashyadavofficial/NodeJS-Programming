-> server-side runtime environment
-> built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine)
-> cross-platform (run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more)
-> open-source
-> back-end JavaScript runtime environment, that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Features:
* Asynchronous and Event Driven: Asynchronous means non blocking. 
Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. 
The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js 
helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.

* Very fast 
* Single Threaded but Highly Scalable : Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping.
*No buffering: Node.js applications never buffer any data. 
               These applications simply output the data in chunks
